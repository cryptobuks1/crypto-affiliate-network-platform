NODE_ENV = what mode should the server be in? development or production
PORT = where the server should listen for incomming requests
SERVER_ADDR = the domain where the server is hosted ( https://mywebsite.com or localhost:port )
CLIENT_ADDR = the domain where the client is hosted ( https://mywebsite.com or localhost:port )
DB_URI = mongodb uri can be acquired on ( https://cloud.mongodb.com/ ) - ask me if you have any questions 
MAILGUN_API_KEY = mailgun api key can be acquired on ( https://www.mailgun.com/ )
MAILGUN_DOMAIN = mailgun domain can be set on ( https://www.mailgun.com/ ) on the dashboard

remove the <> and spaces from the url and replace the stuff between <> with your details acquired on https://cloud.mongodb.com/

server can be started with npm start or npm run dev 
client can be started with npm start or ng serve
client can be compiled to a production bundle with ng build --prod
the bundled files will be in client/dist and should be moved into the server/public folder 

The application is built with server, client seperation which enables 
the client to be re-built or re-constructed or built on a different platform 
and keep the same server. The project is built in the MEAN Stack.

- MongoDB as the database
- Express as the server library
- Angular11 as the client framework
- Node.js as the server run time
